# Artillery Game Project Prototype
Inspired by Konstantin Koshutin's "HighFleet" and my life during the Russo-Ukrainian war, I decided to prototype an Artillery game.

In this game, the player will be in control of an artillery installation. The player's objective is to eliminate targets given to them by their superiors.

## Some notes
The end goal is to create a game with a skeumorphic interface similar to "HighFleet". In this interface, the player would interact with the game from a bunker room with a radio for orders and intel, a control panel for the artillery, an ammo chamber, an ammo rack, a table with a map, compass, and notes, and finally a viewchamber to the outside world (consisting of a horizon).

In the end goal I would like to learn to implement actual graphics and sounds, and most importantly an "intel game" in a way similar to that of my inspiration.

## TODO
The first step is to create what I know is within my skill limits: a text-based prototype for the game.
1. Create an object representing the artillery and its controls
2. Implement a way to control and "fire" the artillery
3. Implement a target generating system
4. Plan next steps
